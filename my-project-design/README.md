## The missing design process between your idea and your codebase.

[Design OS](https://buildermethods.com/design-os) is a product planning and design tool that helps you define your product vision, sketch out your data shape, design your UI, and export production-ready components for implementation. Rather than jumping straight into code, you work through a guided process that captures what you're building and why—then hands off everything your coding agent needs to build it right.

## The Problem

AI coding tools are incredible at building fast. But the results often miss the mark. You describe what you want, the agent builds *something*, but it's not what you envisioned. The UI looks generic. Features get half-implemented. You spend as much time fixing and redirecting as you would have spent building.

**The core issue:** we're asking coding agents to figure out what to build *and* build it simultaneously. Design decisions get made on the fly, buried in code, impossible to adjust without starting over. There's no spec. No shared understanding. No source of truth for what "done" looks like.

## The Design OS Process

Design OS powers a guided design and architecture process. You + AI, working together through structured steps:

1. **Product Planning** — Define your vision, break down your roadmap, and model your data
2. **Design System** — Choose colors, typography, and design your application shell
3. **Section Design** — For each feature area: specify requirements, generate sample data, and design the screens
4. **Export** — Generate a complete handoff package for implementation

Each step is a conversation. The AI asks questions, you provide direction, and together you shape a product that matches your vision—before any implementation begins.
