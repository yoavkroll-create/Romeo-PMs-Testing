# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Upload & Analysis
Upload an MP3 or MP4, separate vocals from instrumentals, and detect the song's tempo, key, and structure (verse, chorus, bridge).

### 2. Style Studio
Browse genre presets or write a custom style prompt, then choose whether to keep the original vocal or generate a new AI voice.

### 3. Regeneration & Preview
AI re-harmonizes, re-arranges, and rebuilds the instrumentation in the chosen style — with an in-browser preview before export.

### 4. Export & Download
Download the final mix as WAV or MP3, pull individual stems, or grab a social-ready short-form version of the remix.

### 5. Billing & Plans
Subscription management with Free, Pro, and Studio tiers — usage enforcement, upgrade flows, and commercial license gating.
