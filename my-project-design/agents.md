# Agent Directives for Design OS

Design OS is a **product planning and design tool** that helps users define their product vision, sketch out their data shape, design their UI, and prepare export packages for implementation in a separate codebase.

> **Important**: Design OS is a planning tool, not the end product codebase. The screen designs and components generated here are meant to be exported and integrated into your actual product's codebase.

---

## Understanding Design OS Context

When working in Design OS, be aware of two distinct contexts:

### 1. Design OS Application
The React application that displays and manages planning files. When modifying the Design OS UI itself:
- Files live in `src/` (components, pages, utilities)
- Uses the Design OS design system (stone palette, DM Sans, etc.)
- Provides the interface for viewing specs, screen designs, exports, etc.

### 2. Product Design (Screen Designs & Exports)
The product you're planning and designing. When creating screen designs and exports:
- Screen design components live in `src/sections/[section-name]/` and `src/shell/`
- Product definition files live in `product/`
- Exports are packaged to `product-plan/` for integration into a separate codebase
- Follow the design requirements specified in each section's spec

---

## Getting Started — The Planning Flow

Design OS follows a structured planning sequence:

### 1. Product Vision (`/product-vision`)
Define your product overview, roadmap sections, and data shape — all in one conversational flow. After answering clarifying questions, all three files are generated automatically.
**Output:** `product/product-overview.md`, `product/product-roadmap.md`, `product/data-shape/data-shape.md`

Use `/product-roadmap`, `/data-shape` individually to update those files after initial creation.

### 2. Design System (`/design-tokens`)
Choose your color palette (from Tailwind) and typography (from Google Fonts). These tokens are applied to all screen designs.
**Output:** `product/design-system/colors.json`, `product/design-system/typography.json`

### 3. Application Shell (`/design-shell`)
Design the persistent navigation and layout that wraps all sections.
**Output:** `product/shell/spec.md`, `src/shell/components/`

### 4. For Each Section:
- `/shape-section` — Define the specification and generate sample data + types
- `/sample-data` — Update sample data and types (if already created)
- `/design-screen` — Create screen designs
- `/screenshot-design` — Capture screenshots

### 5. Export (`/export-product`)
Generate the complete export package with all components, types, and handoff documentation.
**Output:** `product-plan/`

## Design Requirements

When creating screen designs, follow these guidelines:

- **Mobile Responsive**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to ensure layouts adapt properly across screen sizes.

- **Light & Dark Mode**: Use `dark:` variants for all colors. Test that all UI elements are visible and readable in both modes.

- **Use Design Tokens**: When design tokens are defined, apply the product's color palette and typography. Otherwise, fall back to `stone` for neutrals and `lime` for accents.

- **Props-Based Components**: All screen design components must accept data and callbacks via props. Never import data directly in exportable components.

- **No Navigation in Section Screen Designs**: Section screen designs should not include navigation chrome. The shell handles all navigation.

---

## Tailwind CSS Directives

These rules apply to both the Design OS application and all screen designs/components it generates:

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: We always use Tailwind CSS v4 (not v3). Do not reference or create v3 patterns.

- **No tailwind.config.js**: Tailwind CSS v4 does not use a `tailwind.config.js` file. Never reference, create, or modify one.

- **Use Built-in Utility Classes**: Avoid writing custom CSS. Stick to using Tailwind's built-in utility classes for all styling.

- **Use Built-in Colors**: Avoid defining custom colors. Use Tailwind's built-in color utility classes (e.g., `stone-500`, `lime-400`, `red-600`).

---

## The Four Pillars

Design OS is organized around four main areas:

1. **Product Overview** — The "what" and "why"
   - Product name and description
   - Problems and solutions
   - Key features
   - Sections/roadmap

2. **Data Shape** — The "nouns" of the system
   - Core entity names and descriptions
   - Conceptual relationships between entities
   - Shared vocabulary for consistent naming across sections

3. **Design System** — The "look and feel"
   - Color palette (Tailwind colors)
   - Typography (Google Fonts)

4. **Application Shell** — The persistent chrome
   - Global navigation structure
   - User menu
   - Layout pattern

Plus **Sections** — The individual features, each with spec, data, screen designs.

---

## Design System Scope

Design OS separates concerns between its own UI and the product being designed:

- **Design OS UI**: Always uses the stone/lime palette and DM Sans typography
- **Product Screen Designs**: Use the design tokens defined for the product (when available)
- **Shell**: Uses product design tokens to preview the full app experience

---

## Export & Handoff

The `/export-product` command generates a UI design handoff package:

- **Ready-to-use prompts**: Pre-written prompts to copy/paste into coding agents
  - `one-shot-prompt.md`: For full implementation in one session
  - `section-prompt.md`: Template for section-by-section implementation
- **Implementation instructions**: UI-focused guides for each milestone
  - `product-overview.md`: Always provide for context
  - `one-shot-instructions.md`: All milestones combined
  - Incremental instructions in `instructions/incremental/`
- **Test specs**: Each section includes `tests.md` with UI behavior specs
- **Portable components**: Props-based, ready for any React setup
- **Data shapes**: TypeScript interfaces defining what data the components expect

The handoff focuses on UI designs, product requirements, and user flows. Backend architecture, data modeling, and business logic decisions are left to the implementation agent. The prompts guide the agent to ask clarifying questions about tech stack and requirements before building.

---

## Design System (Design OS Application)

The Design OS application itself uses a "Refined Utility" aesthetic:

- **Typography**: DM Sans for headings and body, IBM Plex Mono for code
- **Colors**: Stone palette for neutrals (warm grays), lime for accents
- **Layout**: Maximum 800px content width, generous whitespace
- **Cards**: Minimal borders (1px), subtle shadows, generous padding
- **Motion**: Subtle fade-ins (200ms), no bouncy animations
