# Readiness Check Engine

A reusable, stage-agnostic validation system that determines whether a Romeo Baltio stage is ready to progress.

## Overview

The readiness check runs at the end of any methodology step and produces a binary result:
- **READY** — All required criteria pass. Recommendation: `proceed`.
- **NOT_READY** — One or more required criteria fail. Recommendation: `refine_and_rerun`.

## How It Works

1. Each stage defines its own **criteria configuration** (see Stage Criteria below).
2. The readiness engine evaluates each criterion against the stage deliverables.
3. Results are aggregated using a simple rule: **all required criteria must pass**.
4. The engine outputs a structured result with per-criterion details and missing items.

## Readiness Result Shape

Every readiness check produces this exact structure:

```json
{
  "stage": "{stage-name}",
  "status": "READY | NOT_READY",
  "timestamp": "{ISO date}",
  "criteria_results": [
    {
      "key": "{criterion-key}",
      "name": "{Criterion Name}",
      "required": true,
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "{Why it passed or failed — be specific}",
      "missing_item": null
    },
    {
      "key": "{criterion-key}",
      "name": "{Criterion Name}",
      "required": true,
      "passed": false,
      "explanation": "{What is missing or insufficient}",
      "missing_item": "{Specific item that needs to be added or fixed}"
    }
  ],
  "missing_items": [
    "{Aggregated list of all missing items from failed criteria}"
  ],
  "recommendation": "proceed | refine_and_rerun",
  "summary": "{One-sentence summary of the readiness state}"
}
```

## Aggregation Rule

```
IF all criteria where required=true have passed=true
  THEN status = "READY", recommendation = "proceed"
ELSE
  THEN status = "NOT_READY", recommendation = "refine_and_rerun"
```

Optional (non-required) criteria that fail produce warnings but do not block progression.

## How to Run a Readiness Check

When Romeo reaches the end of a stage (after DoD evaluation), execute this procedure:

### 1. Load Stage Criteria
Read the stage's DoD file from `romeo-baltio/standards/quality/{stage}-dod.md` and map each criterion to the readiness check format.

### 2. Evaluate Each Criterion
For each criterion:
- Check the deliverable(s) it applies to
- Determine pass/fail with a specific explanation
- If failed, identify the specific missing item

### 3. Aggregate Results
Apply the aggregation rule to determine overall status.

### 4. Present Results
Output the readiness result in the structured format above, followed by a human-readable summary:

```markdown
## Readiness Check: {Stage Name}

**Status:** {READY / NOT_READY}
**Recommendation:** {proceed / refine_and_rerun}

| # | Criterion | Required | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | {Name} | Yes | PASS | {Explanation} |
| 2 | {Name} | Yes | FAIL | {What's missing} |
| 3 | {Name} | No | PASS | {Explanation} |

### Missing Items
{If NOT_READY, list each missing item with what needs to happen to fix it.}
1. {Missing item} — {Action needed}
2. {Missing item} — {Action needed}

### Next Steps
{If READY: "Proceed to {next stage command}"}
{If NOT_READY: "Address the missing items above, then rerun the readiness check."}
```

### 5. Record in State
Save the readiness result to `.romeo-state.json`:
```json
{
  "stages": {
    "{stage}": {
      "readiness": {
        "status": "READY | NOT_READY",
        "timestamp": "{ISO date}",
        "passed_count": {N},
        "failed_count": {N},
        "missing_items": [...]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extending the Engine

### Adding a New Stage

To add readiness criteria for a new stage:

1. Create a DoD file in `romeo-baltio/standards/quality/{stage}-dod.md` with criteria.
2. Add a criteria configuration section in this file following the pattern above.
3. The readiness engine will automatically use the new criteria when the stage is evaluated.

### Future: Scoring (V2)

The current engine is binary (PASS/FAIL per criterion, READY/NOT_READY overall). A future V2 can add:
- **Weighted scoring** — criteria have different weights (1-5)
- **Confidence levels** — LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH per criterion
- **Quality score** — 0-100 aggregate score
- **Trend tracking** — how scores change across readiness check reruns
- **Stage comparison** — benchmarking against past projects

The result shape is designed to support this extension without breaking changes — just add `weight`, `confidence`, and `score` fields to the criteria result.
